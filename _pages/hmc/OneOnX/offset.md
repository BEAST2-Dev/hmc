## One On X offset

Offset of origin (defaults to 0), which shifts the distribution by a fixed amount, namely the offset.
Setting the offset to `x` means lower bounds becomes `x`.

This can be useful for example to specify a node calibration with a 1/X distribution when a lower bound is known beforehand.
