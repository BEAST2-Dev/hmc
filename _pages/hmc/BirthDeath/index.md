## Birth Death

Birth Death model based on Gernhard 2008. <br/>This derivation conditions directly on fixed N taxa. <br/>The inference is directly on b-d (strictly positive) and d/b (constrained in [0,1)) <br/>Verified using simulated trees generated by Klass tree sample. (http://www.klaashartmann.com/treesample/) <br/>Sampling proportion not verified via simulation. Proportion set by default to 1, an assignment which makes the expressions identical to the expressions before the change.
