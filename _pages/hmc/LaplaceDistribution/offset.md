## Laplace Distribution offset

Offset of origin (defaults to 0), which shifts the distribution by a fixed amount, namely the offset.
Setting the offset to `x` has the effect of adding `x` to the mean. It does not affect the variance.
This is an option shared with other parametric distributions, but perhaps not as useful as for others, since changing `mu` has the same effect.
