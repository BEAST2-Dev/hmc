## Relaxed Clock number Of Discrete Rates

the number of discrete rates to approximate the rate distribution by. With category parameterisation, a value <= 0 will cause the number of categories to be set equal to the number of branches in the tree. With quantile paramterisation, a value <= 1 will calculate rates for every quantile, a value > 1 will approximate the distribution piecewise linearly with specified number of rates. (default = -1)
