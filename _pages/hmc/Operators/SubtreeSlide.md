## SubtreeSlide operator

Consider using the [BactrianSubtreeSlide](../BactrianSubtreeSlide/) instead.
It produces the same proposals, but is more efficient.

All options for SubtreeSlide and BactrianSubtreeSlide are the same, except the kernel distribution, which is an extra option for BactrianSubtreeSlide.

See [BactrianSubtreeSlide](../BactrianSubtreeSlide/) for detail.
