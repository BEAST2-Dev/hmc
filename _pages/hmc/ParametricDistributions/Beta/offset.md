## Beta offset

Offset of origin (defaults to 0).
The default range of the Beta distribution is from 0 to 1, but with offset it becomes from `offset` to `offset+1`.
It is typically not used with the Beta distribution, but more common with other distributions.

See also [Beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution).
