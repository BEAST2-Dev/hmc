## Uniform upper

Upper bound on the interval of the uniform distribution. 

It can be set to `Infinity`, but that would make the uniform distribution an [improper distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability#Improper_priors) (does not integrate to 1).

The upper bound must be larger than the lower bound.
