## StarBeast3 template -- taxon sets panel

Here, the taxa in the species tree (the *Species/Population*) and gene trees (the *Taxon*) can mapped. This step is vital for ensuring that the taxa are correctly assigned to their species, otherwise the entire analysis will give erroneous results.

To make this task as easy and automated as possible, you should ensure that accession names in the alignment file contain the name of the species. Then, press `Guess` and split on a character or use a regular expression to complete the mapping.

See a tutorial with examples [here](https://beast2-dev.github.io/beast-docs/beast2/STARBEAST/StarBEAST_tutorial.html).
