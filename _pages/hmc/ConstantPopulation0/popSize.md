## Constant population0 pop size

Constant (effective) population size value for the coalescent model used to generate random coalescent starting trees.
Large pop size results in larger trees, smaller pop size in smaller trees.

If the MCMC does not start, possibly trees are too large or small resulting in numerical instability.
In this case, try decreasing or increasing te pop size by an order of magnitude.
